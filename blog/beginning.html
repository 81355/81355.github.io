        <p>
            I've decided to use this site to write down my thoughts. I'd like to begin to make an effort
            to write down anything I find interesting enough.
        </p>

            It may end up sitting here unused or neglected but I think it will be beneficial to have a space to document
            my random thoughts or ideas or rants. I'd also like to talk a little bit about photography as that's probably
            the thing I'm most passionate about at the moment.
